## Overview

The pool price management bot to stabilize overpriced pools during the Gravity DEX incentivized testnet.
This project is developed solely for the purpose of pool price management during the incentivized testnet. 
It is developed in fast-pace; therfore it surely requires some work to generalize the codebase for better adoption and efficiency.
If you would like to use this for your own usage, make sure to go through the codebase thoroughly and change them as you need.

**Note**: Requires [Go 1.15+](https://golang.org/dl/)

## Version
